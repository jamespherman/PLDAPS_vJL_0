function p = reward_calibration_run(p)
%   p = reward_calibration_run(p)
%
% Part of the quintet of pldpas functions:
%   settings function
%   init function
%   next function (before each trial)
%   run function (each trial)
%   finish function (after each trial)
%
% Execution of this m-file accomplishes 1 complete trial
% It is part of the loop controlled by the 'Run' action from the GUI;
%   it is preceded by 'next_trial' and followed by 'finish_trial'
%
% The whole function runs as WHILE loop, checking for changes in eye and
% joystick position. When certain positions are met, the state variable is
% updated

% % %% In this fuction, you may expect:
% % % (1)   Mark start time.
% % % (2)   While-loop:
% % % (2a)  Get voltages for eye position / diameter and joystick position.
% % % (2b)  Check current "state" and respond accordingly.
% % % (2c)  Draw.
% % % (2d)  Wait for joystick relese.

% (1) mark start time in PTB and DP time:
[p.trData.timing.trialStartPTB, p.trData.timing.trialStartDP] = ...
    pds.getTimes;

%% (2) while-loop
% The while loop has 3 sections:
%   (1) STATE-DEPENDENT section: sets variables as a function of state
%   (2) TIME-DEPENDENT section: sets variables as a function of time 
%   (3) DRAW section: PTB-based drawing

    % Update eye / joystick position:
    p = pds.getEyeJoy(p);

    i = i + 1;
    p.trData.onlineEyeX(i) = p.trVars.eyeDegX;
    p.trData.onlineEyeY(i) = p.trVars.eyeDegY;
    
    % STATE DEPENDENT section
    p = stateMachine(p);

%% (1) state-dependent section
% Within each state, some variables are set (eg colors of things to
% draw), some timings are recorded (eg time of fixation acquisition) as
% well as strobed to the ephys recirding system.
%
% Transition from one state to another is deteremined by evaluating
% whether a meaningful event has occured (eg fixation acquired,
% stimulus appeared, etc), or whether a certain amount of time has
% elapsed.
%
% Each state can do a myriad of things, sure, but let it be clear:
% THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF EACH STATE ARE:
%   (a) strobing to ehpys reocrding system
%   (b) recording of the time at which the event occured
%   (c) setting 'p.trVars.currentState' to the next state
%
