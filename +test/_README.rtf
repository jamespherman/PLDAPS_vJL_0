\f0\fs24 \cf0 # README for PLDAPS_vK2\
\
PLDAPS 	= PLexon DAtapixx PSychtoolbox, based on Eastman & Huk 2012. \
vK2 		= version Krauzlis 2 (where version K1 is the standard PLDAPS used in the Krauzlis lab)\
\
PLDAPS_vK2 was written by James Herman & Leor Katz in the great winter of 2018.\
\
The quintet of functions that govern a PLDAPS task are still the same. We have:\
1. settings\
2. init \
3. next\
4. run\
5. finish\
\
The main differences from vK1 are in organization, modularization, generalization, optimization, and another word that ends with 'tion'.\
\
## organization: \
The quintet of files have been organized to exclusively do what their name implies. *_settings have all the settings. \

\cf0 *_Init performs actions that are done only once in the task. \
*_next sets up the very next trial\
*_run exclusively runs the while loop (the "state machine" that is at the heart of PLDAPS)\
*_finish performs actions that take place at the end of a trial.\
\
Every rig/animal gets a rigConfig file that has some basic rig specifications (e.g. screen size, distance from screen etc.). This is loaded by the init file to compute pixels per degree (ppd).\
\
## modularization and generalization:\
The different functions are now saved as their own functions. There are two versions of support functions: task-specific functions and PLDAPS-wide support functions.\
\
## optimizations:\
Removed all magic numbers, minimized redundant code, etc.\
